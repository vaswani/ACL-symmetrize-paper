From a general machine learning perspective, our proposed method can be classified as an unsupervised regularized multi-task learning technique \cite{Evgeniou04,Caruana97}.

Our joint objective (\eqn{eqn:joint}) is inspired by ABA \cite{liang+:2006:align}, which suggests a joint optimization problem for training both directional models. 
The proposed agreement measure
$\sum_\vx \log \sum_{\vz} p_1(\vz \mid \vx; \TA) p_2(\vz \mid \vx; \TB)$
requires access to the posteriors of each sample ($\vx=(\ve, \vf)$) under \emph{both} models.
It is this dependency on parallel data that limits the applicability of the ABA formulation to the parallel data setting.
Therefore, in some sense, our work can be viewed as a generalization of \newcite{liang+:2006:align} beyond the parallel data setting.

Current decipherment work seems to focus on large scale MT experiments \cite{Ravi11,Dou13}. 
We believe our approach would be beneficial in those settings as well.
