\begin{abstract}
  We present a simple approach to encourages jointly trained asymmetric models to agree on their parameter values. In contrast to methods that encourage posterior agreement, our method can be applied even without parallel data. We demonstrate that parameter agreement training leads to state-of-the-art F scores on word alignment, and significantly improves NER on a transliteration task with no parallel data.
