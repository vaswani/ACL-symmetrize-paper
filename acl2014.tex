\begin{abstract}
Learning how to align sequences is a key problem in NLP.
Most approaches model alignment as a directed generative process by which an observed target sequence arises from an observed source sequence. 
In word alignment in particular, symmetrizing inferences of models trained in both directions (source-to-target and reverse) leads to improved alignments.
\marginpar{DC: Something needs to be said here about bidirectionality, or it doesn't make sense. \bluetext{TL: fixed}}
We propose an unsupervised approach for jointly learning bi-directional alignment models by means of maximizing their data likelihoods as well as a measure of model agreement.
In contrast to the ``alignment by agreement'' approach of Liang et al., our method is applicable even without parallel data.
We test our method on two different tasks.
On Czech-English and Chinese-English word alignment, 
we gain 0.4-0.5 BLEU compared to GIZA++ which, Combined with alignments from Liang et al.'s model brings the total improvement to +0.8 $\pm$ 0.1 BLEU.
On a Japanese-to-English back-transliteration task \emph{without} parallel data, our method, when applied to the decipherment model of Ravi and Knight, learns sparser models that reduce whole-name error rate by 33\% relative to a model trained on parallel data.

\section{Conclusion}
We presented Parameter Agreement Training (PAT) - an unsupervised method for jointly training two bidirectional alignment models that encourages agreement on parameter magnitude and does not depend on the availability of parallel data.

Our formulation is based on the simply observation that the entity translation tables of bi-directional models should maintain a soft notion of invertibility. That is the reverse translation of the translation of an entity is itself.

We developed an efficient, theoretically sound optimization algorithm that falls under the EM framework. We demonstrated our algorithm's effectiveness on two alignment tasks, matching state-of-the-art BLEU scores on the word alignment task (with parallel data), and gaining substantial error reductions in the English-to-Japanese back-transliteration decipherment task.

%We have presented Parameter Agreement Training (PAT) - an approach for jointly training two conditional models that encourages agreement on parameter values.
%We derived an optimization procedure based on the EM framework, and argued that it is efficiently solvable due to the concavity of our agreement regularizer.
%In contrast to previous work on agreement training, we have demonstrated that our approach can be successfully applied even without parallel data.

%% this doesn't make a lot of sense
%We present a simple approach that encourages jointly trained conditional models to agree on their parameter values. In contrast to methods that encourage agreement on inferences, our method can be applied in a wider range of settings.
%We demonstrate that our method, called parameter agreement training, leads to state-of-the-art accuracies on word alignment, and significantly improves accuracy on back-transliteration with no parallel data -- almost halving the difference between the previous best method and using parallel data.

%Alignment is a crucial subtask for many larger NLP problems: Word alignments are the backbone for extracting translation rules used in statistical machine translation; phoneme alignments are used to transliterate Japanese katakana to English and vice-versa. The goal is to align entities, which could be words or phonemes, between two sequences, which could be pairs of source and target sentences or pairs of phoneme sequences. The popular models used in these tasks are both \emph{generative} and \emph{directed}, that is, they define a directed sequence of events by which one side of the pair produces the other side. For example, the IBM models for word alignment \newcite{brown+alii:1993} describe a stochastic process by which the target sentence is generated from the source sentence via word alignments. These processes can sometimes produce different alignments, depending on the direction of generation. The generative process for word alignment allows a target word to align to \emph{at most} one source word, producing different alignments in the source-target vs target-source directions. Additionally, the models in each direction are typically trained independently of each other. As a result, they disagree on the alignments they predict and different errors can arise in each direction. To remedy this, we resort to ad-hoc alignment symmetrization approaches \cite{koehn+:2003} \emph{after} training. A second problem for training alignment models is the need for parallel data. For example, in \newcite{KG98}, the authors use (some number) \marginpar{insert number} of parallel English-Katana sequences to training phoneme alignment models. While large amounts of parallel data needed for word alignment is readily available for many language pairs, acquiring parallel phoneme sequences for transliteration can be very challenging. 
%
%There has been previous work on solving the problem of model disagreement in word alignment \cite{liang+:2006:align} and training phoneme alignment models from large amounts of monolingual data~\cite{RK09}. However, they do not optimize a clear objective function and their approach cannot be applied to training alignment models without parallel data. ~\newcite{RK09} alleviate the reliance on parallel data and improve monolingual phoneme alignment over the baseline, but their approach does not encourage model agreement, which can improve alignment accuracy. In our paper, we present a \emph{single} approach that achieves both model agreement during training, and can be used in non-parallel settings. Our approach, \emph{Parameter Agreement Training}, encourages model agreement by adding a regularization term that penalizes disagreement between the (magnitudes of the ?) model parameters in each direction. Our regularizer is convex, allowing us to efficiently optimize the objective function with the EM algorithm. We apply our techniques to word alignment and phoneme alignment. Using our approach, we are able to significantly improve over \newcite{RK09}. In word alignment, our results compare favorably with results from previous approaches for model agreement.
